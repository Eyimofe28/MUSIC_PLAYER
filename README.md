# MUSIC_PLAYER
This code is a Python program that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for a simple MP3 music player using the tkinter library. When executed, it opens a window with options to add songs, play, pause, stop, and navigate through a playlist of MP3 songs. Users can also adjust the volume of the music. The program uses the pygame library to play the MP3 files and the mutagen library to retrieve song duration information. It provides basic music player functions like playing, pausing, stopping, and skipping to the next or previous song. Users can also delete songs from the playlist and clear the entire playlist. The program displays the name of the currently playing song and a slider to control the song's position and volume. The user interacts with the program through buttons and a list of songs displayed in the GUI.
